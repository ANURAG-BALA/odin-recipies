    <h2>Easy Red Sauce Pasta Recipie</h2>
    <p>Learn how to make a plain, simple, no-frills, basic red sauce that tastes great on a variety of pasta and is not watered down with this recipe. For making a good sauce, use canned tomatoes. Except for summer months, "fresh" tomatoes are usually harvested when green and left a long time to ripen. Add more red pepper flakes if you like your sauce spicy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (29 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>12 ounces angel hair pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm oil in a medium saucepan over low heat and sauté garlic; heat through until garlic turns translucent, not brown. Add onion and cook over low heat until translucent; 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add parsley, basil, and black pepper; stir. Add tomatoes and cover; raise heat to medium and bring to a strong simmer. Lower heat and add red pepper flakes. Cover the saucepan and cook for 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Continue to let the sauce cook over medium-low heat uncovered for 10 minutes or until it thickens. The sauce can be run in the food processor for 2 to 3 seconds to achieve a more uniform consistency.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and serve with sauce.</li>
    </ol>
